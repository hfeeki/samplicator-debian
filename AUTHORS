The orginal author of the package could not be identified with
absolute certainty.  He or she is believed to be from the Italian
research networking community.

David Harmelin (DANTE) has added the sampling feature.

Simon Leinen <simon.leinen@switch.ch> removed lots of unused code,
implemented source address spoofing and packaged the program for
easier compilation/installation.

Otmar Lendl <O.Lendl@KPNQwest.at> added source-dependent rules
and config-file parsing.

Vladimir A. Jakovenko <vovik@lucky.net> contributed a patch that makes
source address spoofing work under BSD-derived systems such as FreeBSD
and OpenBSD.  These require an additional socket option (IP_HDRINCL).

Juraj Sucik <Juraj.Sucik@cern.ch> found a bug that would cause the
`spoof' option to be randomly enabled even though the `-S' argument
wasn't passed to the program.

James Sella <sella@digital-genesis.com> contributed the `-s' (bind to
specific address) and `-f' (fork into background) options.

Gary Mikula <g2ugzm@hotmail.com> contributed UDP checksum
generation in `spoof' mode.

Brad Dreisbach <bradd@ntt.net> found and fixed a portability issue in
rawsend.c that broke spoofing mode for little-endian Solaris systems.

John Heasley <heas@shrubbery.net> found and fixed the int/long type
error in setsockopt() calls.
